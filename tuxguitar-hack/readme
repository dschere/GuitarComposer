Rework the musicxml to export data so that our backend can play the song 
rather than tuxguitar. This allows me to avoid having to write a music editor.

Eventually I would like to but at least this allows me to create the back end
and have it functional.

Procedure:

1. Write score using tuxguiatr
2. export song as a musicxml file
3. run my app to play the musicxml file.
