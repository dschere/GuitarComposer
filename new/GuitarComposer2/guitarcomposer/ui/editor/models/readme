The editor models are presentations of a score on the screen. The
models are used to generate a song model which is the actual representation
of a peice of music. 

The editor module is concerned with where things are on the screen 
and how to render them. There is a linear coordinate system based
on beats being a left<-->right dimension. The beat unit determines
which measure a note/rest is in and at what position. Repeats are
markers and do not influence the beat value.

repeats and measures are used strictly during playing of a score.
the beat value is the number of beats from the first note.


concepts:

moment - the total beats from the start of the song
measure - using the timesig events this is computed value to
          trigger a end of measure visual on the screen.
          notes can span measures.
 
 rest - a note without a key and only duration indicating an idle 
        instrument state.
        
 
 
 example of a moments event queue
 
     + ----> key, timesig, tempo
     + ----> note 
     + ----> rest
     + ----> start repeat 
     + ----> notes/rest
     + ----> end repeat
     + ----> new timesig
     + ----> note/rest ...
     
as moments are enqueued or inserted at various positions in the array.
