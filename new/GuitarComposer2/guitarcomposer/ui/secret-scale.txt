Flippin' heck mate - that is the best guitar lesson I've ever had!  So in terms of scale tones its:  1 2 b3 3 4 b5 5 6 b7 BUT you shift to match the current chord.  [corrected - I missed out the 5] You absolute star! You have completely blown my mind. I've been playing guitar for years and never discovered it. Thank you so much! You know on the inside of the gatefold sleeve of Led Zep IV there is a mysterious figure holding a lantern? Thats you that is.
