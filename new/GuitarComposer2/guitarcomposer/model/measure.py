# here for historical purposes until deleted.
# the measure is too inter dependant on a track
# if the moment in music changes for a note due to
# a new note being inserted before a note on the 
# the tablature then all notes that follow must change.

# thus a measure can't be represented by an object it
# is simply a book keeping artificat. Its just tracks containing
# a list of notes.
